# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

superhexagon: Super Hexagon is a minimal action game by Terry Cavanagh (creator of
superhexagon: VVVVVV) — guide your triangle around a rotating hexagon and avoid the
superhexagon: incoming lines. In this deceptively simple game, you’ll have to deal
superhexagon: with a spinning screen and rapidly changing colors synced to brain-
superhexagon: pumping music.
