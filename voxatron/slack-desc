# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

voxatron:
voxatron: Voxatron is an action/adventure game set in a world completely made
voxatron: of tiny cubes that can be built, blasted to smithereens, and collapse
voxatron: in per-voxel detail. Watch voxel snow settle on the scene perfectly,
voxatron: shoot the voxel leaves off a voxel tree or cut through the trunk and
voxatron: watch the whole thing collapse into voxels. There are lots of voxels
