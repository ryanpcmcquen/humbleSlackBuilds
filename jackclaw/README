Don’t expect much from this, as it is a prototype. The fullscreen mode messed
up my screen resolution every time I exited the game, so this will default to
windowed mode. If you lose your cursor at some point, use Ctrl+G to get it
back. After installation, run (not as root I’d imagine) the script
setup_user.sh that comes with the SlackBuild. Then, if you feel adventurous
enough, you could mess around with your ~/.frozenbyte/claw/config/options.txt
file for stuff like vsync, fullscreen etc.:

render_use_vsync = 0 (change to 1 to enable)
screen_height = 768
screen_width = 1024
windowed = 1 (change to 0 for fullscreen)
