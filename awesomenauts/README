This requires:

- Awesomenauts-Linux-2013-5-21-3.bin

NOTE #1: This is the DRM-free version of Awesomenauts. It only works offline with
bots, or your local friends on the same computer. If you want to play this
online and with its DLC, you must redeem it on Steam.

NOTE #2: The first time you run the game, you'll be presented with a dialog to
configure basic options (e.g. resolution, vsync). To access this dialog again,
run the game from the command line, like this:

awesomenauts --settings
