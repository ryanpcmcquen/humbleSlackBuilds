# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

littleinferno:
littleinferno: Throw your toys into your fire, and play with them as they burn. Stay
littleinferno: warm in there. It's getting cold outside! Burn flaming logs,
littleinferno: screaming robots, credit cards, batteries, exploding fish, unstable
littleinferno: nuclear devices, and tiny galaxies. An adventure that takes place
littleinferno: almost entirely in front of a fireplace - about looking up up up out
littleinferno: of the chimney, and the cold world just on the other side of the
littleinferno: wall.
