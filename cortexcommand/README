This requires one of the following:

- cortex_command-1.0rc1-linux-amd64.bin
- cortex_command-1.0rc1-linux-i686.bin

Cortex Command saves its data inside the installation directory, not in some
hidden directory in $HOME. So make sure you add your user to the group "games":

su -c 'usermod -a -G games USERNAME'
