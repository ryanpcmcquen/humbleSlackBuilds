- I won't be providing updates to the scripts, nor add new games in the future.

  felt nice to share them :-)

- awesomenauts, capsized, hotlinemiami, littleinferno, proteus,
  thomaswasalone: added (Humble Indie Bundle 8). As for "Dear Esther", I
  haven't figured out how to bypass the graphical installer yet. This is
  actually a crossover bottle. Fortunately, there is a native port in the
  making (by Icculus).

April 11, 2013
- anomaly: updated to 1364850491.

April 9, 2013
- atomzombiesmasher: updated to 1.953. Finally, they provided a proper package.
  The bundled libraries seem to work fine now, so no extra deps are required.

March 9, 2013
- beathazard: updated to 1.67.

March 7, 2013
- superhexagon: updated to version 15.

March 6, 2013

  below), dynamitejack, solar2 and superhexagon. nightsky had already a Slack-
  Build.
- dungeondefenders: the new version (7.48) has additional DLC. This requires the
  PulseAudio library (32-bit). Also it no longer suffers from the SDL bug the
  previous build did.

February 23, 2013
- vessel: updated to 02222013.

February 18, 2013
- trine: use trine-launcher to start the game (instead of trine-bin directly)
  because trine-launcher provides configuration options that are not exposed
  by the game's options menu.

January 16, 2013
- offspringfling: updated to 1.1.3.

December 21, 2012

  fatal IO error 11" issue (see the accompanying README). Now that I could test
  the game, I also changed $VERSION from "12182012" to the proper one, 7.46c.
- shank2: added.

December 20, 2012
- Added Humble Indie Bundle 7: closure, dungeondefenders, grimrock, snapshot.

- isaac: added hib7 version to the existing SlackBuild.

November 21, 2012

November 19, 2012

  information, see the enclosed README file.

November 16, 2012
- Fixed a typo in canabalt's README i.e. a misspelled link to my ftp server.

November 14, 2012

  blocksmatter, chocolatecastle, darwinia, defcon, dredmor, isaac,

  Slackware64.

October 24, 2012
- Edited most of the *.desktop files to add a file extension to the field
  "Icon". The reason is that the application menu of the newer XFCE (4.10)
  won't display the icons of the games otherwise.

October 22, 2012
- aquaria, penumbra: added.

October 21, 2012
- gish, lugaru: added.

October 13, 2012
- cortexcommand: updated to 1.0rc1.
- rochard: updated to 1.32.

October 9, 2012
- atomzombiesmasher: the script now requires the latest update patch (1.94).
- bit.trip.runner, crayonphysicsdeluxe, fieldrunners: removed the part that
  downloaded additional libraries; they now run fine on Slackware 14.0.
- shadowgrounds: removed a bunch of bundled libraries that prevented the game
  from running on Slackware 14.0.
- survivor: same as above.
- torchlight: updated to 1.15_20120926.
* All SlackBuilds now include a README file that contains information such as
  the name of the required game copy, possible dependencies, and other notes.
* All packages are now installed under /opt/hib/<game> instead of /opt/<game>.
  The reason is that the number of the games is getting bigger and bigger, so
  it's better to have them in a separate folder. sh launchers remain in
  /usr/games/.
* All builds have been tested on Slackware 14.0, which is the latest stable
  release, and the only one that I'll be maintaining the scripts for.

September 29, 2012
- rochard: updated to 1.31.

September 27, 2012
- bit.trip.runner: updated to 1.0_4.

  SlackBuild).
- fieldrunners: updated to 1.0.0_1346296515 (32bit) and 1.0.0_1346776333
  (64bit). Added fix for stuttering audio (thanks to the Arch folks).
- jamestown: modified SlackBuild, to remove excess unpacked data, to free-up
  space in $TMP a bit earlier.
- spacechem: updated to 1.0.12_2 and switched from deb to rpm.
- swordandsworcery: updated to 1.02 (thanks Thraphyx).
- torchlight: updated to 1.15_20120924.
- wizorb: added.

September 21, 2012
- Fixed a mistake in torchlight's SlackBuild: there was a hardcoded reference
  'lib64' which is now changed to 'lib$LIBDIRSSUFFIX'.
- Small 'cosmetic' change to shatter's SlackBuild, the resulted package is
  100% the same though :-)

September 20, 2012
- Added Humble Indie Bundle 6: dustforce, rochard, shatter, spaz, torchlight.

September 1, 2012
- Updated frozensynapse (1.0.32).

August 25, 2012
- Fixed fieldrunners SlackBuild; the new version (1.0.0_1345663134) needs a
  more recent libc.so than the one provided by Slackware 13.37.
- Updated psychonauts (08152012).

August 24, 2012

June 29, 2012
- Fixed a flaw of the SlackBuilds; all the scripts would proceed regardless of
  errors (e.g. an unsuccessful extraction of the game archive) when run like
  this:
  $ sh game.SlackBuild
  Now the scripts use "set -e" instead of the "#!/bin/sh -e" shebang line.

June 22, 2012
- Removed an escaped backslash from amnesia and swordandsworcery SlackBuilds
  that caused a (harmless) error when updating the desktop database.
- Updated bastion (20120620).

  installation.

May 2, 2012
