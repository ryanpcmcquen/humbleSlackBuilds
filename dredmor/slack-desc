# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

dredmor: Long ago, the Dark Lord Dredmor was bound in the darkest dungeons
dredmor: beneath the earth by great and mighty heroes. Centuries later, the
dredmor: magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power
dredmor: grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful
dredmor: warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of
dredmor: yore.
