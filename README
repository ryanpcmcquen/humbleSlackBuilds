These SlackBuilds provide a clean installation of the Humble Indie Bundle games
on a Slackware machine. They are meant to be used only on Slackware's latest
stable release. Of course, you will need a copy of each game, usually the
tarball or, when there is no tarball, the *.sh/bin/run installer.

The games are installed under /opt/hib/<game>/, and a launcher under
/usr/games/ (Slackware's default path for game executables).

A default Slackware installation has 95% of the libraries you'll need (and I
generally leave the libraries that come bundled with the games alone, unless
they become a problem). As for the rest, like OpenAL or Mono, you can get from
slackbuilds.org. Also, some of the games are 32bit-only, so if you're running
Slackware64, you'll have to setup multilib first. To do this, have a look at
Eric Hameleers' wiki page:
