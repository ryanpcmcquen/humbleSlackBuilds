The Linux port is horribly slow. This is a known issue. Until this is fixed,
I highly recommend running the Windows version through Wine which works as
expected. You can find Slackware packages for Wine (both 32-bit and 64-bit) at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/Slackware%20Packages/

If you still want to run the Linux port, it requires:

- vessel-02222013-bin
- multilib (Slackware64)
