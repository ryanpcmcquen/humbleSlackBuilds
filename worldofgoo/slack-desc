# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

worldofgoo: globs create rigid planks upon being placed in proximity to other goo
worldofgoo: balls, and with your help, they can escape! World of Goo is an indie
worldofgoo: classic.
