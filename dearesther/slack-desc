# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

dearesther: dearesther (A first-person adventure game)
dearesther:
dearesther: Dear Esther isn’t what you might consider your typical video game,
dearesther: but therein lies the beauty of it. Instead, it’s an experimental
dearesther: first-person adventure, strongly driven by a fractured narrative. Let
dearesther: yourself wander the abandoned island and its desolate and dreary
dearesther: beaches, and get lost in the sounds of the surf and wind as you try
dearesther: to piece together who you are, and why you were brought to the
dearesther: island.
